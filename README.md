tugas Web programing

this project is made without anything in mind, so execuse the simplicity of it.

In the home page, I use a simple image and bootstrap button that can be used to travel to another page. i add the current page's button 
to make the transition seem smooth. the  buttons is placed in a different container than the rest of the content.

In the Profile page,  it is a simple profile about me. here i use the table and the list(ordered and unordered) from the html.

In the social link, here i use the column from bootstrap and make them divided by 4.

In the credit,  is as the same as the social link, with a link to the background image website.

in the style file there is 3 selector . the id(#table), class(.menu), element(body).

i also change a couple thing in the main css file, like the color and the rounded angle of the buttons.
